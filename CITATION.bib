    abstract = {This paper introduces the Julia package IsoME, an easy-to-use yet accurate and robust computational tool designed to calculate 
                superconducting properties. Multiple levels of approximation are supported, ranging from the basic McMillan-Allen-Dynes formula 
                and its machine learning-enhanced variant to Eliashberg theory, including static Coulomb interactions derived from GW calculations, 
                offering a fully ab initio approach to determine superconducting properties, such as the critical superconducting temperature (Tc) and 
                the superconducting gap function (Δ). We validate IsoME by benchmarking it against various materials, demonstrating its versatility and 
                performance across different theoretical levels. The findings indicate that the previously held assumption that Eliashberg theory 
                overestimates Tc is no longer valid when μ⁎ is appropriately adjusted to account for the finite Matsubara frequency cutoff. Furthermore, 
                we conclude that the constant density of states (DOS) approximation remains accurate in most cases. By unifying multiple approximation 
                schemes within a single framework, IsoME combines first-principles precision with computational efficiency, enabling seamless integration 
                into high-throughput workflows through its Tc search mode. This makes IsoME a powerful and reliable tool for advancing superconductivity research.}
